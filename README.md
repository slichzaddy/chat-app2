# Realtime Chat App 

Realtime Chat App is built on ReactJS, NodeJS and socket.io. 
This allows user to chat with multiple friends in the same room using socket.io capabilities. This is built to enable friends to play games and chat. User can send emojis, scroll up and down,
and chat with numerous friends.

The components are client and server side. Server side node modules have been accidentally deleted at the time of upload, but have been hosted successfully. 
Server is hosted on Heroku and Client is hosted on Netlify for a seemless free experience. 

The product has been developed while learning about ReactJS and NodeJS, and is strictly a final draft as an experiment. 
Further development can be done by adding chat storage and retreival facility and making chatting groups of contacts.
